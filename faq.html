      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <h3>Where do I go when it is my time to serve?</h3>
      <p>All Serving Shifts originate from the Base Camp located at Kautz Field, just South of Memorial Gym, 303 East Superior Street, Kokomo, IN 46901.</p>
      <h3>Should my Kids create accounts?</h3>
      <p>f they are 16 years and older, yes.  If younger than 16, no just bring them along and pick a family friendly project.</p>
      <h3>Can I sign up as a family?</h3>
      <p>Yes. Everyone in the family that is 16 years and older should JOIN the same project individually.  This is for emergency contact or contact information for errand running, etc…  Also, projects have multiple tasks so family members with diverse skills can be on the same project but may be doing different tasks.  If you find a project you all want to do together, you can filter by project here:<br><img src='css/images/faq-project-list.jpg'><br>Use the 'Filter by Project' drop down menu to unselect all projects then select the project your family wants to sign up for together.  This will then only show that project and you will not have to scroll through all of the projects to sign up together.  Once you select only one project you will have a short project list, only showing the selected project:<br><img src='css/images/faq-project-join.jpg'></p>
      <h3>How do I sign up as a group?</h3>
      <p>Each person (not household, everyone individually) should sign up individually.  Look for projects that need enough people for your size of group. You can filter by project here:<br><img src='css/images/faq-project-list.jpg'><br>Use the 'Filter by Project' drop down menu to unselect all projects then select the project your family wants to sign up for together.  This will then only show that project and you will not have to scroll through all of the projects to sign up together.  Once you select only one project you will have a short project list, only showing the selected project:<br><img src='css/images/faq-project-join.jpg'></p>
      <h3>How do I remove myself from a project?</h3>
      <p> Login in to <a href="http://www.hiskingdom.needsgap.com/serveTogether">www.hiskingdom.net</a> using the email and password from sign up.  Under the menu “My Memberships”, select the link for the project you want to remove.  You can then remove yourself from the project-task here. Please add a note that will be sent to the leader.</p>
